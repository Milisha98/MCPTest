I would like to create a Project Requirements Document, prd.md

The site name is Latest Epicor Changes. 

It will return the 5 latest changes to the [Erp].[Customer] table returning:
 - CustID
 - Name
 - Last Updated By (ChangedBy)
 - Last Updated Date (ChangeDate)

The sort order will be ChangeDate and ChangeTime, both in descending order.

Please present the results in a table format.
